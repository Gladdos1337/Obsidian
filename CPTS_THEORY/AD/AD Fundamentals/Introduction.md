The release of Windows Server 2003 saw extended functionality and improved administration and added the `Forest` feature, which allows sysadmins to create "containers" of separate domains, users, computers, and other objects all under the same umbrella. [Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services) was introduced in Server 2008 to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) to systems and applications for users on Windows Server operating systems. ADFS made it simpler and more streamlined for users to sign into applications and systems, not on their same LAN.

ADFS enables users to access applications across organizational boundaries using a single set of credentials. ADFS uses the [claims-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity) Access Control Authorization model, which attempts to ensure security across applications by identifying users by a set of claims related to their identity, which are packaged into a security token by the identity provider.

The release of Server 2016 brought even more changes to Active Directory, such as the ability to migrate AD environments to the cloud and additional security enhancements such as user access monitoring and [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-group-managed). gMSA offers a more secure way to run specific automated tasks, applications, and services and is often a recommended mitigation against the infamous Kerberoasting attack.

It was first shipped with Windows Server 2000; it has come under increasing attack in recent years. It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default." It is difficult to manage properly, especially in large environments where it can be easily misconfigured.

Active Directory flaws and misconfigurations can often be used to obtain a foothold (internal access), move laterally and vertically within a network, and gain unauthorized access to protected resources such as databases, file shares, source code, and more. AD is essentially a large database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level. A basic AD user account with no added privileges can be used to enumerate the majority of objects contained within AD, including but not limited to:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Domain Computers|Domain Users|
|Domain Group Information|Organizational Units (OUs)|
|Default Domain Policy|Functional Domain Levels|
|Password Policy|Group Policy Objects (GPOs)|
|Domain Trusts|Access Control Lists (ACLs)|
Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.

At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:


```
